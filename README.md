# LogoWayRay_OGL
Logo WayRay where i used very simple beginning things with OpenGL.

Using:
There are two examples that I just split into two main files.
1.Application.cpp - flashing logo with interval time(shaders which you can using "vertex.shader and Fragment_2.shader")
2.Test_Color_attribute.cpp - color logo.(shaders which you can using "vertexTCA.shader and FragmentTCA.shader")
If you use Visual Studio, you can exclude or include desired file in the project
